“Practice exercises

  This style of coding takes some getting used to. You’ll use the techniques presented here throughout the book, but you should try to write a couple such iterations yourself. The following are some exercise ideas that may help you get into the swing of things.

  Using large_lines!/1 as a model, write the following functions:

  
    
      A lines_lengths!/1 that takes a file path and returns a list of numbers, with each number representing the length of the corresponding line from the file.
    

    
      A longest_line_length!/1 that returns the length of the longest line in a file.
    

    
      A longest_line!/1 that returns the contents of the longest line in a file.
    

    
      A words_per_line!/1 that returns a list of numbers, with each number representing the word count in a file. Hint: To find the word count of a line, use length(String.split(line)).
    
  

  Solutions are provided in the enum_streams_practice.ex file, but I strongly suggest you spend some time trying to crack these problems yourself.”
